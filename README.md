# Loupe Works

### Loupe Works is going to be a web-based image processing application

I'm going to base it off of already available open-source image processors like [gimp](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) and [Dark table](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable)

Since these are both written in C, I'm thinking there must be a way to migrate them to Javascript or Typescript
